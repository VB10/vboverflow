Dm yolu veya mail ile gelen soruları ortak bir alanda toplayıp yarın başka bir arkadaşa çözüm üretmek amacıyla açılmış bir gönüllü repo.


## 🛠 Skills
Hemen hemen tüm mobil programlama disiplinleri, backend ise business seviyesinde okar yazar bilirim.


## Support

Bir issue görüp sende çözüm atarsan canımsın.

## Soru sorma adımları

- Önce başlıkta küçük bir özet
- Sorunu kendi problemini çözmek üzerine değil acaba tüm projelerde olsa nasıl olurdu diyerek düşünme



## Nasil soru sorulmamali!

👩‍💻 Ornek seneryo: 

Abi benim böyle bir projem var:

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Bu kısımda takıldım yardımcı olur musun?


🧠 Abi senin gösterdiğinin aynısını yaptım çalışmıyor flutter'da sorun mu var?

👯‍♀️ Dart yazmadan flutter öğrenebilir miyim?

🤔 Kodu yazdım

💬 Ask me about...

📫 How to reach me...

😄 Pronouns...

⚡️ Fun fact...
